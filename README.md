# 🏫 Automatic Attendance Recording Application

## Overview

The **Automatic Attendance Recording Application** is a web-based system designed to eliminate inefficiencies in traditional attendance tracking within educational institutions. This project integrates a secure and user-friendly interface with modern technology to ensure reliable and automated attendance recording.

### Why This Project?

I developed this application to improve outdated school attendance systems. During my university years, attendance was tracked via sign-in sheets or roll calls, leaving students unaware of their records. By integrating QR codes and location-based tracking, I aimed to enhance accuracy and reduce fraudulent attendance.

### Testing & Results

The application was tested at my university for 5 weeks, during which 162 people logged in and 652 attendances were marked. This trial helped validate its efficiency, usability, and reliability in a real-world academic setting.

## 🌟 Features

✅ **QR Code-Based Attendance** – Professors generate unique QR codes for each session, which students scan to mark attendance.\
✅ **Location-Based Validation** – Ensures students are physically present during attendance logging.\
✅ **Secure Access Control** – Prevents unauthorized attendance marking using session-based validation.\
✅ **Comprehensive Attendance Reports** – Professors and students can easily track and export attendance records.
